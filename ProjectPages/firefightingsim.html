					Most of my projects have a relatively small coding aspect to them. Not giving me a big opportunity to enhance my coding skills.
					Games are a great way to practice and improve coding skills in an engaging way. I've recently done an internship with a NASA project group where the subject was wildfire managment.
					Taking inspiration from this, I have come up with a "Firefighting Sim/Game". This sim/game will demonstrate some of the ways wildfires are started, enviromental factors that contribute to them,
					and how firefighters deal with them. Ultimately this project is intended to be both programming practice and an outreach project.

					<h4>Basic Fire</h4>
					<p>
						The first step to this project is a very basic visual for the fire. Unity already has a particle system built in which is perfect for fire. A few minutes of changing settings and I came up with
						the fire pictured below. The particles start as vibrant yellow squares, then increase in size and move to a dark orange color as they rise. This is only intended to be a low polygon visual
						for the early stages of testing. Next the fire needs to spread. This was completed by finding all of the burning objects in the scene, and checking in a certain radius around
						them for any flammable object. For every object found, there is a random chance that it will ignite on each "tick" of the game. A tick is a time period variable I can set, usually at 3 seconds. Finally I wanted
						to be able to easily see the chance of any particular object igniting, so I created a UI element that checks the percent chance that a clicked object will ignite and display that value as a radial slider
						on the object. The color inside that slider changes to correspond to the likelihood of ignition, with red being most likely and green being least likely. A video example can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/DonovanMagney/status/1548706909712269316"><u>here</u></a>.
						Thats it for a basic skeleton of the fire mechanics!

					<h4>Ignition Chance Visualizer</h4>
					<p>
						For the basic implementation of fire, I just set an arbitrary percent chance that a flammable object nearby will ignite. Environmental variables that can be modified
						to change the ignition chances would make the fire more realistic. Some variables will be easy to test, as they apply to everything in the scene, such as humidity. But others like range and wind are harder to test because the values
						are different in every location. To make testing easier, I decided to create a grid of small objects around a burning object that I call the "visualizer". Instead of burning themselves, these objects will turn to
						the color on a color gradient corresponding to their ignition chance. Red objects are the most likely to ignite, blue objects are the least likely. The visualizer proved invaluable trying to implement
						the enviromental variables, and will further be useful when tuning these variables later in the completed game.

								</figure>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<h4>Completed Fire Modifiers</h4>
					<p>
						With the visualizer implemented, I set to work adding 4 variables to ingition chance, these are: humidity, fuel type, range, and wind. High humidity decreases ignition chance, while low humidity increases it. Certain
						fuels such as trees are less likely to start burning, and fuels such as grass are very susceptible. Ignition chance decreases as the range from the burning object and the flammable object increase. Finally, objects in the direction
						of the wind also have an increased chance of burning. Each of these variables (except fuel type) have curves associated with them to allow non-linear changes to the ignition chances. Each of these
						variables can also be turned on and off. This will be useful in allowing the player to play with individual settings to see how they alone change the behavior of the fire. In the future things like amount of sunlight objects are recieving
						or topography factors may be added as modifiers.

					<p>
						Now that the basic fire mechanics are in place, it would be benificial to work on a UI, this would allow me to do more work in the game itself and avoid having to restart the game
						whenever I make changes. An improved player version of the burn chance indicator would also require this. Then once a UI is in place, firefighting abilities will be much easier
						to implement and test.
