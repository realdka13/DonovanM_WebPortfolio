            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              One fundamental practice during Analog missions are the extra vehicular activities (EVAs), which are focused on getting the Analog Astronauts to perform several experiments an open and controlled environment,
              getting accustomed to wearing heavy suits, and getting familiar with their tools. One of the suits that LunAres uses for EVAs is known as the PUMA suit, which has a ventilation
              system for the analog astronaut to breathe comfortably and a CO2 sensor to measure the level of carbon dioxide that is occupying the volume within the helmet.

            <h2>Modules</h2>
            <h3>Airflow</h3>
            <h5><i>Problem</i></h5>
            <p>
              During EVA 0, the crew noticed an issue with low airflow into Puma suit. During the EVA, the EVA Lead noticed they were breathing heavily even when idle, and the temperature inside the helmet would get uncomfortably hot. After the EVA,
              the backpack was opened and it was discovered that the fan was not secured properly in the backpack, causing it to not be able to intake air efficiently. This also caused an additional problem of the air hose connector on the backpack
              moving around significantly when trying to attach the air hose.
            </p>

              <figcaption class="caption">Problem gap between the fan and the backpack</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h5><i>Final Design</i></h5>
            <p>
              The final design features a 2 piece mount. The first component we call the connector, which interfaces with the air hose and routes the fan exhaust into it, and the second which we call the funnel, because it funnels the air from the relatively
              small hole on the backpack exterior to the larger hole on the fan. The connector features a long extrusion under the fan exhaust that allows a bolt to be installed which secures it to the sides of the backpack. The funnel is a funnel shaped piece
              with drilled bolt holes to secure it to the backpack exterior, and separate holes to secure it to the fan. Separating the mounting holes means we were able to use much shorter screws that we had on hand and that the assembly could be remove form
              the backpack without taking it apart.

            </figure>

            <h3>Wiring</h3>
            <h5><i>Problem</i></h5>
            <p>
              While trying to solve the issue with the airflow, the team found that the internal wiring of the backpack was very difficult to understand, and most of it unsecured to the backpack itself.
              This meant that in the process of debugging the airflow issue, we had to spend a couple hours just trying to learn and understand the current state of the wiring. This was amplified by an incomplete schematic.
              It was also possible for the messy wiring to come loose due to its own weight and cause a failure if not properly secured.
            </p>
            <h5><i>Final Design</i></h5>
            <p>
              The final design utilizes velcro to secure large components and wire bundles. Electrical is used to electrically isolate the wires. Electrical tape ended up being used over heatshrink as it was easier to apply and remove, and was able to serve as its own label
              (black for GND, red for VCC). Most individual components have a label applied, as well as a few important wires. The length of many wires were also cut down to only what is necessary. A USB hub was also
              added later so that the backpack could power up to 4 USB devices. Currently those devices are the LEMs device (life support sensor readout), the helmet sensor, and the two LEDs on the front straps of the backpack. By recommendation
              from a previous crew, the backpack also now has a charging switch. This switch cuts off power to the charging port to prevent accidental shorts during an EVA. This switch should be ON when charging, and OFF all other times.

            <h3>Helmet sensor</h3>
            <h5><i>Problem</i></h5>
            <p>
              Wearing a helmet designed to hold in pressure also means that CO2 cannot escape. The backpack airflow is designed to bring in fresh air for the astronaut, and it is important to monitor
              if that system is functioning correctly and has enough performance to keep the astronaut safe. A previous crew appears to have attempted to add the ability to measure CO2 and temperature inside the helmet, 
              but ran into the problem of having to run a wire inside the helmet to power it. Due to it needing to hold pressure it of course doesn't have any holes that would easily allow wires to run through without modification.
            </p>
            <figure>
              <img style="width: 500px; height: auto;" src="../assets/img/portfolio/PumaHelmet.PNG" alt="Puma suit helmet" class="center">

            </figure>
            <h5><i>Final Design</i></h5>
            <p>
              The easiest place to route the wire through was an old air connection (not the one in use for ventilation). This access point had a sort of plug that we were able to take apart and
              reveal the actual hole in the helmet. We were then able to 3D print a part that would fit into the hole and allow the wire through. For the aesthetics, we also added back the rubber
              cover from the original plug to our 3D print. The helmet was not damaged at all and is able to be restored to its original condition. We also moved the Raspberry Pi
              to the exterior of the helmet secured with velcro to improve its internet connection.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              The Puma backpack had a few issues that put the analog astronaut inside it at risk, such as the inoperative ventilation system. Even if this system did work, there was a risk of failure during an EVA due to the rushed assembly of the wiring. Tweaks were made to the ventilation mounting mechanism and the wiring
              cleaned up to mitigate these issues, and a CO2 sensor inside the helmet implemented to monitor the astronauts safety in real time. The new system was tested on an actual EVA and performed flawlessly despite being intentionally shaken and required to continue running for multiple hours.
