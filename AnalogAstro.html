      I participated in my first analog astronaut mission at LunAres Research Station in Piła, Poland. The primary
      objective of this analog mission is to study isolation. This means that for 2 weeks, we were not allowed to use view the news, watch any live feeds,
      or communicate with anyone on the except by email (mission control was the exception). I served as the mission commander of the Space Bears crew!
      The name comes from the regenerative abilities of axolotls, and the resiliancy of tardigrades, aka water bears. So we went with Space Bears. As the
      commander, I was responsible for the crew, including their safety, performance, and well-being. I also had to coordinate each day's objectives and also serve as
      the primary contact between the crew and mission control.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      The Space Bears consisted of 5 members. Nationalities of the members are Poland, Morocco/Canada, USA, and Mexico. For fun we also came up with callsigns related to this mission name.
      These were Teddy, Red Panda, Atlas, Polar Bear (myself), and Grizzly, and we would refer to mission control as Mama Bear. We were a somewhat unique crew as we were all introverts,
      nearly all engineers, and the first all male crew at LunAres.

      <figcaption class="caption">Collecting geology samples during an EVA</Caption></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      We had to do many things during our short time there, but the most exciting parts were the EVAs. LunAres has a simulated Lunar
      landsape inside an old aircraft hanger which provided plenty of space to conduct the EVA activites while at the same
      time keeping isolation from the outside enviroment. Multiple EVAs were conducted and collect geological samples, conduct equipment tests,
      and sometimes run “surprise” scenarios to test our attention to detail and problem solving skills.

    </figure>
    <p>
      When not on EVAs, we would participate as test subjects for outside researchers and work on engineering projects which would improve either the mission equipment
      or the habitat itself. The project that occupied most of my time was the enviromental systems backpack for one of the EVA suits. The EVA suits do not actually
      provide a pressurized seal like real ones would, but they still had very restricted airflow. The backpack was designed to bring fresh air into the astronaut's
      suit and provide power for the few sensors they must carry. More details about this project can be found on the <a href="ProjectPages/EVAEnviroSys.html" title="More Details">project page</a>.

    </figure>
    <p>
      We had busy schedules so there wasn't too much free time, but every so often we were able to squeeze in some activities. As a big group of introverts, we would
      usually watch movies. A popular one for crews to watch on the mission is The Martian due to the obvious correlation (check it out if you havn't seen it!).
      Movie were made even more fun with the ambient LED in the hab. For The Maritan, we would set the ambient lighting to an orange-red when Mark Watney was doing his EVAs,
      and set it to blue when he was inside the hab. This was similar to the movies lighting style.

      During this mission, we had to eat mostly Huel, which is powdered food in which you would mix with hot water to rehydrate. We had access to a few other things like
      rice, noodles, bread, and frozen fruit, but Huel had to be our primary source of calories. While I didn't mind this too much, we very quickly realized 3 powdered
      meals a day would get old really quick, so we came up with a couple of creative recipies such as the one shown above. We would use Huel as a sauce for rice and noodles,
      then cook chicken to add for extra protein. Being creative with the ingredients you have on hand is important in isolation.

    </figure>
    <p>
      By the end of the 2 weeks what we were all most looking forward to was definitely having access to different foods again. After opening the doors at the end of the mission,
      we had a small picnic on top of the hanger and ate chips, candy, and drank sodas while taking in the sunlight. Thankfully we had good weather!

    </figure>
    <p>
      To comemorate our mission, most crews develop a mission pin and place it on a map of the moon. We took this one step further and create a sculture of sorts. It consisted
      of a bear in a space suit with the flags of each crew members nationality and our mission name. We then took a strong to pin the spot on the map where our simulated mission
      took place. We decided upon Mare Serenitas, the location of the actual Lunar mission where tardigrades were intended to land. We then wrote an article describing the location
      and each crew member and then signed it.

      Participating in LunAres was one of the most rewarding experiences I've had so far. Despite the hard work, I had a lot of fun. I learned more about being effective leadership
      and guiding the team to meet its goals. I am greatful for the opportunity form the LunAres team and I'm definitely looking forward to joining many more analog missions in the future.

    <h2>Scuba Diving</h2>

    <p>
      Scuba Diving is an activity that I knew about but only really discovered after learning more about the Neutral Buoyancy Lab at NASA. After digging into it more,
      it seemed that there ar quite a few astronauts that also are scuba divers. Some divers also say its one of the closest ways to experience weightlessness without
      actually going to space or spending a lot of money on a parabolic plane ride. So I then started pursuing my certification.
      <br><br>
      Despite not being an avid swimmer, I found scuba diving to be an awesome experience. While I'm not good at it, it is very unusualy to have 3 dimensions you can travel
      in at will. There is then of course the ability to breathe in an enviroment that humans are not supposed ot be able to survive in. One of my favroite parts of training
      was during the underwater navigation portion where a school of fish came by and watched me traverse for a little while.
      <br><br>
      I intend to continue my scuba training by earning my Advanced Open Water and Rescue Diver certifications, as well as trying out ice diving!

    <h2>Private Pilots License</h2>
    <h5>May 2022</h5>
    <p>
      After reading many astronaut bios and learning the history of spaceflight, I realized that learning to fly would be a very useful for my astronaut goals.
      During the spring of 2022, I had a semester off of school that I did not want to go to waste, and I figured this was the perfect time to get my Private Pilots License

      <figcaption class="caption">Cessna-152 I used for most of flight training</Caption></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Flying is one of the most fun activities I have ever taken part in. The training took about 3 months and I loved every minute of it. It was not unusual for me to book
      multiple flights a day because I just kept wanting more. My favorite flight was the night flight. Being able to see the sunset multiple times and the city lights from above
      are unlike any other view I've seen up to then.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the future (financial and time dependent), I would like to continue my training by earning an instrument rating, as well as getting a tailwheel endorsment. I also
      have an interest in aerobatics after watching performers at airshows. Maybe one day I will be one of those performers!
