					The 2017 FIRST Robotics competition “STEAMworks”, involved shooting fuel (whiffle balls) into a tall goal as well
					as grabing and placing gears on a springy peg. The gears are then pulled up by a human into an “airship” and used to
					score points. Gears are delivered to the field from slots in the corners in an area called the “feeder station” and robots can only have possession of one gear at a time. I
					was tasked with mentoring 2-3 students on the design and development of a mechanism to collect those gears
					from the feeder station and place them on the peg.

					The completed mechanism was dubbed the “gear scoop”. It features a clear polycarbonate chute to guide the
					gear into the scoop after being dropped from the feeder. The chute has a cutout in the shape of the gear which
					gives space for the peg to be inserted into any one of the openings of the gear. Once on the peg, the scoop will
					lower which removes the gear from the scoop. This lowering ability was chosen over opening doors as it would
					then allow the robot to pick up dropped gears from alliance members or the humans inside the airship. A
					camera was also mounted with a 3D printed bracket behind the chute to assist the drivers in lining up the gear
					on the peg. Due to it being mounted on the side of the robot, mecanum wheels were required to allow sideways
					motion.

					<p>
						The gear scoop performed its function much better
						than expected. The ability to pick up gears from the
						floor was intended to be used up against walls,
						either by the feeder or the airship. However, it was
						discovered during testing that it could pick up gears
						in the middle of the playing field with ease. Initially
						it was intended as an add-on since the focus was on
						scoring with fuel but focusing on gears turned out
						to be the winning strategy during the competitions.		
						The scoop allowed us to win 1st place at on off-season (unofficial) competition.
