  <h1 class="w3-center">About Me</h1>
  <p>Hard working student with a passion for learning new things and striving to utilize my skills pushing the boundaries of space exploration for the betterment of our species. I also find it important to encourage others, especially minorities, to get involved STEM fields by doing things like promoting FIRST Robotics and participating projects that will show off how much fun hard work really is!</p>
  <p>As a child I've always had an interest in space, learning about the stars, planets, and just the vastness has always amazed me. As I got older I learned more about our history in space such as the Mercury, Gemini, and of course, the Apollo programs. These programs, combined with the amazing experience of FIRST Robotics brought me into the College of Science and Engineering studying Computer Engineering.</p>
  <p>On February 6th, 2018, SpaceX launched a Tesla Roadster into space as a test flight for their newest rocket, the Falcon Heavy. This was the very first launch livestream that I have ever watched, and immediately knew I wanted to be involved in advancing spaceflight! Since then I have been learning everything I can about anything related to rockets, while continuing my Computer Engineering degree.</p>
